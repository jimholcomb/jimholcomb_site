Stuff I'm working on:
* Learning how to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to create a web site. It ain't pretty, but it works (my fault, not Hugo's). The pages are uploaded to [Github](https://github.com/) and I use [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) to deploy the site.
* Small board computers - Arduino Uno R4 and an ancient Raspberry Pi - original model B. I'm using a couple of 16x2 LCDs to display the time and date, and temp and humidity are pulled from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) on the Arduino. The Pi is pulling statistics from my [Adguard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html) ad blocker. Also a Zima Board that I install various OS's on.
* My homelab - running a couple Proxmox servers to host my virtual machines. Things like Plex, Unbound DNS on FreeBSD, [Adguard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html), Wireguard VPN, etc. Previously used HyperV, VirtualBox, and ESXi but really enjoy using Proxmox. Almost all of my VMs are running Debian, with a couple FreeBSD machines and of course Windows. Also, I have a couple of Docker VMs to host some of this.
* Speaking of virtual machines, I'm testing out [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) on my Mac to replace Parallels. Parallels is absolutely the best virtualization software for the Mac but when that yearly subscription fee comes due it kinda seems wasteful when there are so many other free options.
* [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/) firewall. Now, I have no need for a firewall at the moment, although I had used pfSense in a virtual machine to create a site to site VPN from my home to the office in the past (with a lot of help from a coworker). Do I need a reason to do this? No. It's a science project. It's running on a [Zima Board](https://www.zimaspace.com/) which is a pretty cool lttle single board server.
* [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) home automation. I have a few temperature and motion sensors around the house.
