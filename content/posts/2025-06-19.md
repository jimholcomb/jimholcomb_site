Stuff I'm working on:
* Learning how to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to create a web site. It ain't pretty, but it works (my fault, not Hugo's). The pages are uploaded to [Github](https://github.com/) and I use [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) to deploy the site. All free except the domain name.
* Small board computers - Arduino Uno R4 and an ancient Raspberry Pi - original model B. On the Arduino I'm using a 16x2 LCD to display the time, date, temp, and humidity. Temp and humidity are pulled from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/). The Pi is pulling statistics from my [Adguard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html) ad blocker to display on another 16x2 LCD. Also a [Zima Board](https://www.zimaspace.com/) that I install various OS's on.
* My homelab - running a couple Proxmox servers to host my virtual machines. Things like Plex, Unbound DNS on FreeBSD, [Adguard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html), Wireguard VPN, Docker, etc. Previously used HyperV, ESXi, and VirtualBox but I'm really enjoying using Proxmox. Almost all of my VMs are running Debian, with a couple FreeBSD machines and of course Windows. 
* Speaking of virtual machines, I'm testing out [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) on my Mac to replace Parallels. Parallels is absolutely the best virtualization software for the Mac but when that yearly subscription fee comes around it seems wasteful when there are so many other free options and this isn't exactly an production environment.
* [pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/) firewall. Now, I have no need for a firewall at the moment, although I had in the past used pfSense in a virtual machine to create a site to site VPN from my home to the office (with a lot of help from a coworker). Do I need a reason to do this? No. It's a science project. It's running on the Zima Board which is a pretty cool little single board server.
* [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) home automation. I have a few temperature and motion sensors around the house.
